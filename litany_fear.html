    <h1>The Litany Against Fear</h1>
    <p>
      I must not fear.<br>
      Fear is the mind-killer.<br>
      Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.<br>
      I will face my fear.<br>
      I will permit it to pass over me and through me.<br>
      And when it has gone past, I will turn the inner eye to see its path.<br>
      Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.
